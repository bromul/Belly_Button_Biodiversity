# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview

Using data provided by Biological Researchers at Improbable Meats, we created a dashboard that allows researchers and subjects to choose a subject ID number and see their demographics, as well as vizualizations of the amount and differing kinds of bacteria fonud within their belly button, and a gauge of their weekly navel-cleaning habits. 

### Purpose

Researchers at Improbable Meats believe there is a bacterium contained within subjects' belly buttons that can be harvested and utilized to imitate the taste of beef - without harming a cow in the process. This project collated the data a offered visualizations of key data points that researchers require and subjects may want to see.
